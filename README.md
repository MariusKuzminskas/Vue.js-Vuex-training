## Added Vuex to Vue.js project  

> Learned how to add Vuex to Vue.js project. Saw the difference between props state management and Vuex. 
> Vuex really is the way to go, because it makes all the state management centralized in the store. The code is much more readable, understandidle. Thank Academind for this tutorial.
